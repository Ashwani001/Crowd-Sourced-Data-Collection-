Crowd-Sourced-Data-Collection-
==============================

"Are you a researcher who needs to collect data about locations? If so, then this app is for you." This is an Android app with a similar concept as google maps engine. This app will have the structure already in place, all you need to do will be to customise it as per your need. The current App is to map all the Fruiting Trees in Singapore.
